4. d - lage chi-sqare value means two variables are not close
5. b - 1.5*IQR=1.5*(Q3-Q1)= 19.2, lowbond= 37-19.2=17.8, upperbond=49.8+19.2=69

b:why mean similar but sd are not

The mean is the average of all numbers. Standard deviation is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or 
dispersion of a set of data values.

The data in Set A has high density around 0-6 and set B is random sampling from set A. That means data values 0-6 have high
probability to be choosed.    

c. the statistical principal - Central Limit theorem 
The central limit theorem (CLT) is a statistical theory that states that given a sufficiently large sample size from 
a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately 
equal to the mean of the population. Furthermore, all of the samples will follow an approximate normal distribution 
pattern, with all variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population divided by each sample's size.
